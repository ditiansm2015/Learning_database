**----------------------------------------------------- Day 1 -----------------------------------------------------------**

                                          **Day 1 - Flipkart Customer Interaction**

Built two python classes -  Flipkart and Dbhelper and created a small interactive CLI to let a user create his user account (by entering Name, Email ID password) or login (by passing Email ID and password). 

Upon successful login the user is greeted as "Hello Customer_name". If the login attempt fails the user is shown relevant message. 

This is done by connecting the python code with the database. We have used XAMPP to visualize the database. I

nstall XAMPP and run the following on browser to access the DBMS on local server -  http://localhost/phpmyadmin
